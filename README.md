## 💡 Description

This MCP server allows the use of natural language to execute any CLI for Microsoft 365 commands. It may handle complex prompts that will be executed as a chain of CLI for Microsoft 365 commands that will try to fulfill the user's request. Thanks to this, you may manage many different areas of Microsoft 365, for example: Entra ID, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Planner, Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Platform, SharePoint Embedded, SharePoint Online, Teams, Viva Engage, and many more...

For best results, use it with Claude Sonnet 4 or Claude Sonnet 3.7.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- CLI for Microsoft 365 installed globally (`npm i -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365`)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

<h3>
  👉 Check out the <a href="https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/using-cli-mcp-server/" title="CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP Server Guide">CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP Server Guide</a>
</h3>

</h3>

This MCP server uses the globally installed [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365) that you need to install globally using `npm i -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365`.

After you install the CLI for Microsoft 365 perform the initial setup by running the:

```
m365 setup
```

For more information, please follow the [Log in to Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/connecting-microsoft-365)

After you set up the CLI for Microsoft 365, please update its configuration using the following commands:

```
m365 cli config set --key prompt --value false
m365 cli config set --key output --value text
m365 cli config set --key helpMode --value full
```

This will ensure that the MCP server will get as much information as possible from the CLI for Microsoft 365 when an error occurs or when a command is not executed properly.

The MCP server will not do any authentication for you. You will need to first authenticate using CLI for Microsoft 365 using [m365 login](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/login) command. Once you are authenticated, the MCP server will use the same authentication context when running any tool.

Lastly, install the MCP server on your preferred MCP client, referring to the instructions of the picked MCP host. Below, you may find guidance for VS Code.

### Add to VS Code

There are multiple ways to add the MCP server to VS Code. The most common way is to:

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and type `MCP: Add Server`.
2. Select `Command (stdio)` as the server type.
3. Enter the command to run the MCP server, which is:

   ```
   npx -y @pnp/cli-microsoft365-mcp-server@latest
   ```
4. Name the server (e.g., `CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP Server`).

As a result, you should have the following configuration in your `.vscode/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP Server": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@pnp/cli-microsoft365-mcp-server@latest"
          ]
        }
    }
}
```

Now when you open the GitHub Copilot chat in VS Code, you should be able to select the `CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP Server` from the list of available MCP servers and start using it to manage Microsoft 365 using natural language. In the prompt specify that "Using CLI for Microsoft 365, I want you to..." and GitHub Copilot Agent will use the MCP server to execute your request.

### Add to GitHub Copilot CLI

If you are using [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli), you may add the CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP server to Copilot by doing the following:

1. First of all start the [Copilot CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot) by running:

```
  copilot
```

2. Use the copilot mcp command to add the MCP server:

```
  /mcp add
```

3. This will open up the MCP form where you need to fill in the following details:
- Server name: basically whatever you like, but do not use space bar characters, e.g `cli-microsoft365-mcp-server`
- Server type: select `Local`
- Command: `npx`
- Arguments: `"-y", "@pnp/cli-microsoft365-mcp-server@latest"`
Rest of the fields you may leave with default values.

After that click on `Ctrl+S` to save the MCP server and `q` to exit the MCP form. 
Now you should be able to use the CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP server in GitHub Copilot CLI by specifying it in your prompt, e.g. "Using CLI for Microsoft 365, I want you to...".

### Add to Claude

When using [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) you may add the MCP server by doing either using the dedicated `.mcpb` file present in this repo (recommneded) or by adding it manually to the Claude Desktop configuration.

#### Using the .mcpb file (recommended)

## 🏗️ How to build and run it locally

Before anything, first run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then, in order to build the project run:

```
npm run build
```

### Running MCP in VS Code from local build

It is also possible to run the MCP server in VS Code from your local build so that it may be used by GitHub Copilot Agent.
First, start the CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP server using the command:

```
npm run start
```

Now go to VS Code GitHub Copilot Agent mode click on the tools icon, and select `Add more tools`. Then select `Add MCP server` and then `Command (stdio)` and enter the following command:

```
node FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT/dist/index.js
```

Click Enter and name it however you like. It is recommended to add it to `workspace` scope for testing. After that, open up your `.vscode/mcp.json` file and modify it so pass the environment variables needed for auth.

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "m365-mcp-server": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT/dist/index.js" // e.g. C:/workspace/repo/microsoft-365-mcp-server/dist/index.js
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Running MCP from local build using the inspector (Debugging)

One of the ways to test the CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP server is by using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector). 
Mostly, this setup is used for debugging purposes and to test the MCP server locally.
First, start the MCP server using the command:

```
npm run start
```

Now, in order to run the inspector for your MCP server, you need run the following command in the repo root folder location:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

After that, wait for the inspector to start and open the inspector in your browser. You should see the MCP server running, and you should be able to query the tools and execute them locally.
